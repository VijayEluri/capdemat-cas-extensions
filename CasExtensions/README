Introduction
============

This project constains the adaptations made to the CAS (Central Authentication
Service) for the CVQ project.
They are aimed to be reused by other CG95 projects that will want to benefit
from the SSO capabilities offered by the CAS project.

Build
=====
Run ant cas-extensions on the command line.
That will produce a cas-extensions-{version}.zip that contains a JAR file, some
JSP files (and maybe other things in the future).
Unzip this file in the home of the CAS server webapp and that's it.

Post-Install
============
Edit the WEB-INF/web.xml file in the CAS server webapp and enable service
restrictions by adding the value /WEB-INF/approvedServices.xml in the parameter
contextConfigLocation. 
Edit the WEB-INF/approvedServices.xml file and change the serviceRegistry's
class to fr.cg95.sso.cas.CvqServiceRegistry

TODO
====
Wait for the CAS team to finish specification of the Single Sign Out and adapt
our installation in consequence.
Wait for the CAS team to finish moving LDAP authentication to core and adapt our
installation in consequence.
