Introduction
============

This project constains the adaptations made to the CAS (Central Authentication
Service) for the CVQ project.
They are aimed to be reused by other CG95 projects that will want to benefit
from the SSO capabilities offered by the CAS project.

Build
=====
Run ant cas-extensions on the command line.
That will produce a cas-extensions-{version}.zip that contains a JAR file, some
JSP files (and maybe other things in the future).
Unzip this file in the home of the CAS server webapp and that's it.
